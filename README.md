This is a simple **Pong** game implemented in Python using the `turtle` module.  
I created this project while learning Python to practice working with object-oriented programming, game loops, and event handling.

- Two-player paddle control  
- Ball bouncing mechanics  
- Score tracking  
- Game over when a player reaches 3 points  

## How to Play 🎮  
- **Left player:**  
  - Move up: `S`  
  - Move down: `X`  
- **Right player:**  
  - Move up: `↑` (Up Arrow)  
  - Move down: `↓` (Down Arrow)  
- Press **Q** to quit the game  

## Requirements 📌
